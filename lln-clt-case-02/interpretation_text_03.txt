As the sample size n grows the distribution of the standardized sample average denoted z subscript overline y gets closer to the standard normal distribution illustrated by the red dashed curve.

Remeber, z subscript overline y is calculated as overline y minus p divided by sigma over square root of n.

This is the result of the central limit theorem.

Based on this result we can now conduct hypothesis tests on the parameter probability of success p.
