Step1: A sample of size n is drawn from the a Bernoulli distribution with probability of success p.

Step 2: The sample average of the outcomes, i.e., yi equals 1, and no success, i.e., yi equals 0, are calculated based on the sample drawn.

Step 3: The value of the sample average, i.e., overline Y, is stored.

Step 1 to step 3 is repeated 1000 times resulting in 1000 sample averages.

Remember, due to the randomness of the generated sample the outcomes of the samples will vary across sample draws.

The distribution of sample averages, i.e., overline y, and the standardized sample average, i.e., z subscript overline y, are illustrated using histograms.

Remember, due to the different outcomes of the samples the sample averages will vary across sample draws.
