# OLS: Case 1

This illustrations shows the sampling properties of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient $\beta_1$ based on the following DGP,

\begin{align}
Y_i &= -2 + 3.5 X_i + u_i, \\
X_i &\sim N\left(0,10\right), \\
u_i &\sim N\left(0,10\right).
\end{align}

Change the number of observations $N$ to see the effect of the sample size on the properties of the OLS estimator for the slope coefficient $\beta_1$.
