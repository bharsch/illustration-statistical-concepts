## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of the observed values. i.e., their relative frequency, based on an automatic bin selection procedure for one particular realization of the DGP.

The observed values are evenly distributed between the lower bound a and the upper bound b.

## Slider 1

Changing the sample size only changes the bins of the histogram whereas the relative frequencies of the observed values approximately stay the same across bins.

## Slider 2

Increasing/decreasing the lower bound decreases/increases the range and the relative frequencies of the observed values for one particular realization of the DGP from the left.

## Slider 3

Increasing/decreasing the upper bound increases/decreases the range and the relative frequencies of the of observed values for one particular realization of the DGP from the right.

# Figure 2

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of all estimated sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.

The red vertical dashed line represents the sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.

The green vertical dashed line represents the mean of the underlying DGP.

## Slider 1

By increasing the sample size the sample average concentrate more around the mean used to generate the data.

This is the result of law of large numbers.

## Slider 2

Increasing/decreasing the lower bound a decreases/increases the mean of the underlying DPG and shifts the histogram to the left/right.

## Slider 3

Increasing/decreasing the upper bound b increases/decreases the mean of the underlying DPG and shifts the histogram to the right/left.

# Figure 3

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of all standardized sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.

The red vertical dashed line represents the standaradized sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.

The green vertical dashed curve represents the pdf of the standard normal distribution.

## Slider 1

By increasing the sample size the sampling distribution of the standardized sample average gets closer to the standard normal distribution which pdf is illustrated by the green dashed curve.

This is the results of the central limit theorem.

## Slider 2

Changing the lower bound a does not effect the results of the central limit theorem.

## Slider 3

Changing the upper bound b does not effect the results of the central limit theorem.
