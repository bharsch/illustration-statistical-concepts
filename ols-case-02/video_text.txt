Figure 1: Scatterplot

Overall:
-> The figure shows the observations of X and Y and the fitted regression line for one simulation.
-> So there are 25 dots because we have a sample of size 25 and each dot reprsents one observation.
-> The fitted regression line is fitted based on these 25 dots.
-> The red shaded area shows the range of all fitted regresion lines across all simulations.
