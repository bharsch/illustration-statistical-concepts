
# Figure 1

## Overall

The figure shows the barplot of the the number zeros and ones for one particular realization of the DGP.

## Slider 1

Increasing the sample size increases the number of zeros and ones for one particular realization of the DGP.

## Slider 2

Increasing the probability of success increases the number of ones for one particular realization of the DGP.

# Figure 2

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of all estimated sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.

The red vertical dashed line represents the sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.

The green vertical dashed line represents the mean, i.e., the propability of success, of the underlying DGP.

## Slider 1

By increasing the sample size the sample average concentrate more around the mean, i.e., the probability of success, used to generate the data.

This is the result of law of large numbers.

## Slider 2

Changing the probability of success, i.e., changing the mean of the underlying DGP, shifts the histogram.

# Figure 3

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of all standardized sample averages for all realizations of the DGP.

The red vertical dashed line represents the standaradized sample average for one particular realization of the DGP.

The green vertical dashed curve represents the pdf of the standard normal distribution.

## Slider 1

By increasing the sample size the sampling distribution of the standardized sample average gets closer to the standard normal distribution which pdf is illustrated by the green dashed curve.

This is the results of the central limit theorem.

## Slider 2

Changing the probability of success does not effect the results of the central limit theorem.
