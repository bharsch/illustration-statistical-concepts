Sample Draw / Simulation of DGP:
Different sample draws result in different estimates and thus different fitted regression lines illustrated by the red shaded area.

Sample Size
Increasing the sample size decreases the range of the different fitted regression lines across different sample draws illustrated by the red shaede area.
