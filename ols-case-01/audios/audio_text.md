# Figure 1

## Overall

The figure shows the scatter plot of the values of x and y and the corresponding fitted regression line for one particular sample draw.

The red shaded area illustrates the range of all fitted regression lines across all sample draws.

## Slider 1

A different sample draw result in a different estimate and thus a different fitted regression line illustrated by the red dashed line.

## Slider 2

Increasing the sample size decreases the range of the different fitted regression lines across different sample draws illustrated by the red shaded area.

# Figure 3

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of the estimated slope parameter across all sample draws.

The red vertical dashed line represents the estimated slope parameter for one particular sample draw.

The green vertical dashed line represents the population slope parameter used to generate the data.

## Slider 1

A different sample draw result in a different estimate for the slope parameter represented by the red vertical dashed line.

## Slider 2

By increasing the sample size the estimated slope coefficients concentrate more around the population slope parameter used to generate the data.

This is the result of law of large numbers.

# Figure 3

## Overall

The figure shows the histogram of the standardized estimated slope parameter across all sample draws.

The red vertical dashed line represents the standardized estimated slope parameter for one particular sample draw.

The green vertical dashed curve represents the pdf of the standard normal distribution.

## Slider 1

A different sample draw results in a different standardized estimate for the slope parameter represented by the red vertical dashed line.

## Slider 2

By increasing the sample size the sampling distribution of the standardized estimated slope coefficient gets closer to the standard normal distribution which pdf is illustrated by the green dashed curve.
